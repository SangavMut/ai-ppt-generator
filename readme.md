PowerPoint Generator Using Gemini AI

# Overview

This is a Python-based PowerPoint presentation generator that leverages AI (via Gemini AI- gemma-3-27b-it) to create dynamic, data-driven presentations. The tool allows users to input a topic, specify the number of slides, and receive a fully automated PowerPoint presentation. The generated slides include a mix of text-based content and relevant images. Itâ€™s designed to assist with content generation and save time for anyone who regularly creates presentations.
